## Upgrading the Protocol & Constitution

> #### Upgrading the Protocol & Constitution

---

===

> The EOS.IO software defines the following process by which the protocol, as defined by the canonical source code and its constitution, can be updated:
>
> 1. Block producers propose a change to the constitution and obtains 15/21 approval.
> 2. Block producers maintain 15/21 approval of the new **constitution **for 30 consecutive days.
> 3. All users are required to indicate acceptance of the new constitution as a condition of future transactions being processed.
> 4. Block producers adopt changes to the source code to reflect the change in the constitution and propose it to the blockchain using the hash of the new constitution.
> 5. Block producers maintain 15/21 approval of the new **code **for 30 consecutive days.
>
> 6. Changes to the code take effect 7 days later, giving all non-producing full nodes 1 week to upgrade after ratification of the source code.
> 7. All nodes that do not upgrade to the new code shut down automatically.

 ===

> By default, configuration of the EOS.IO software, the process of updating the blockchain to add new features takes 2 to 3 months, while updates to fix non-critical bugs that do not require changes to the constitution can take 1 to 2 months.
