> The EOS.IO software will be first and foremost a platform for coordinating the delivery of authenticated messages \(called Actions\) to accounts. The details of scripting language and virtual machine are implementation specific details that are mostly independent from the design of the EOS.IO technology. Any language or virtual machine that is deterministic and properly sandboxed with sufficient performance can be integrated with the EOS.IO software API.
