## 时序性能

> #### Sequential Performance

---

一些应用因为顺序依赖关系的执行步骤而不能使用并发算法实现。比如交易所就需要足够的时序性能来处理很高的交易量。因此，平台需要拥有快速的时序性能。

> There are some applications that just cannot be implemented with parallel algorithms due to sequentially dependent steps. Applications such as exchanges need enough sequential performance to handle high volumes. Therefore, the platform should support fast sequential performance.
