> ## Transaction Confirmation

===

> Typical DPOS blockchains have 100% block producer participation. A transaction can be considered confirmed with 99.9% certainty after an average of 0.25 seconds from time of broadcast.

===

> In addition to DPOS, EOS.IO adds asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance \(aBFT\) for faster achievement of irreversibility. The aBFT algorithm provides 100% confirmation of irreversibility within 1 second.
