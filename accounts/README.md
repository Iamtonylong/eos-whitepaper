EOS.IO允许使用唯一的不超过12个字符的具有良好可读性的用户名来关联账户。账户的创建者可以设置这个名称。在这个新账户的权益可以支付自身的RAM之前，账户的创建者必须支付RAM空间来存储这个新账户。

> The EOS.IO software permits all accounts to be referenced by a unique human readable name of up to 12 characters in length. The name is chosen by the creator of the account. The account creator must reserve the RAM required to store the new account until the new account stakes tokens to reserve its own RAM.



> In a decentralized context, application developers will pay the nominal cost of account creation to sign up a new user. Traditional businesses already spend significant sums of money per customer they acquire in the form of advertising, free services, etc. The cost of funding a new blockchain account should be insignificant in comparison. Fortunately, there is no need to create accounts for users already signed up by another application.
