# Governance

> #### Governance

---

===

> Governance is the process by which people in a community:
>
> 1. Reach consensus on subjective matters of collective action that cannot be captured entirely by software algorithms;
> 2. Carry out the decisions they reach; and
> 3. Alter the governance rules themselves via Constitutional amendments.

===

> An EOS.IO software-based blockchain implements a governance process that efficiently directs the existing influence of block producers. Absent a defined governance process, prior blockchains relied ad hoc, informal, and often controversial governance processes that result in unpredictable outcomes.

===

> A blockchain based on the EOS.IO software recognizes that power originates with the token holders who delegate that power to the block producers. The block producers are given limited and checked authority to freeze accounts, update defective applications, and propose hard forking changes to the underlying protocol.

===

> Embedded into the EOS.IO software is the election of block producers. Before any change can be made to the blockchain these block producers must approve it. If the block producers refuse to make changes desired by the token holders then they can be voted out. If the block producers make changes without permission of the token holders then all other non-producing full-node validators \(exchanges, etc\) will reject the change.
