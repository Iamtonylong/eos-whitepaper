# 背景

> ## Backgroud

随着2008年比特币的诞生，区块链技术被提出，从那之后企业家和开发者们就开始尝试总结推广这一技术，以实现在单一区块链平台上支持更为广泛的应用程序。

> Blockchain technology was introduced in 2008 with the launch of the Bitcoin currency, and since then entrepreneurs and developers have attempted to generalize the technology to support a wider range of applications on a single blockchain platform.

而一些区块链平台努力的支持可运作的去中心化应用，具体的应用比如 BitShares 去中心化交易所 \(2014\) 和 Steem 社交媒体平台 \(2016\) 已经成为每天被成千上万活跃用户重度使用的区块链。在这过程之中，他们把性能提升到了每秒处理上千交易，延迟降低到1.5秒，减少了手续费，并且提供了堪比现有中心化服务的用户体验。

> While a number of blockchain platforms have struggled to support functional decentralized applications, application specific blockchains such as the BitShares decentralized exchange \(2014\) and Steem social media platform \(2016\) have become heavily used blockchains with tens of thousands of daily active users. They have achieved this by increasing performance to thousands of transactions per second, reducing latency to 1.5 seconds, eliminating per-transaction fees, and providing a user experience similar to those currently provided by existing centralized services.

现存的区块链平台负担着大量的交易费和受限的可计算能力，这都阻碍了区块链技术的大面积应用。
